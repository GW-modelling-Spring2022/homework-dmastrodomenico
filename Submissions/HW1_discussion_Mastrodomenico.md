# Discussion Points
1. A boundary condition are constraints for the solution of a boundary value problem. 
2. A model parameter is a configuration variable that is internal to the model and whose value can be estimated from data. 
3. A steady state is a state or condition of a sytem or process that does not change in time. 
4. Model inputs can be stored in different formats and different sheets within Excel instead of other spreadsheet cells. 
5. An iterative solution is a mathematical way of solving a problem which generates a sequence of approximations. Excel can't automatically calculate a formula that refers to a cell either directly or indirectly. We must determine the number of times the formula should recalculate in order for excel to solve the problem. 
6. A direct solution gives a precise answer. The disadvange of direct solution compared to iterative solution is that you can only use direct in finite linear equations. While iterative you can use more complex linear equations.
